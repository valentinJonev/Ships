About us
========

Who are you?
------------
We are two computer science students from Bulgaria. We are currently 11-th grade and we are looking into gainig more experience. We are `Martin Dimitrov`_ and `Valentin Yonev`_ . Martin is responsible for the *awful* design of the application and I am responsible for the *buggy* code behind it. 

What do you do for fun?
-----------------------
Outside of our school and job lives we like to listen to *lots* of music, watch movies, go to cafes, *bla bla bla*. But we also enjoy hiking, skiing, riding bikes and playing games. We both like extreme sports like paragliding and canoe kayak.

How to contact you?
-------------------
Well, you can contact us by writing us an email (`Martin's email`_ , `my email`_) or by messaging us on Facebook. We will be very happy to answer your questions so you can write us about everything. Even for a beer if you are close enough to us. :)
